# FruitRecog: Fruits Recognition System

FruitRecog is a machine learning-based system designed to recognize various types of fruits from images. Leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, it offers a lightweight yet effective solution for fruit classification tasks.

## Key Features

- **Fruit Classification**: Utilizes the KNN algorithm to classify fruits based on their features extracted from input images.
- **Simple Setup**: Easy to set up and use, making it accessible to both beginners and experts.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of the KNN model parameters to adapt to different datasets or requirements.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and performance of the classification system.

## Dataset
